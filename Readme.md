A fun game development project in Python OOP during a short New Year vacation between french classes.

It was a good opportunity to review once again all major Python concepts by coding and solving challenges, while reading “Python crash course : a hands-on, project-based introduction to programming”  by Eric Matthes.

Project description.

The Alien Invasion project uses the Pygame package to develop a 2D game. The goal of the game is to shoot down a fleet of aliens as they drop down the screen, in levels that increase in speed and difficulty.

Deployment instructions.

Install Python 3 from python.org, clone the game’s repo, cd into the game folder, run the game:
pyhton3 alien_invasion.py

That’s it!

Details will follow.
